**Hypothesis Testing and Dependency Analysis on Sales Data**

This project involves testing hypotheses and analyzing dependencies using the sales data provided in the "Sales_add.csv" dataset.

**Description**

The project conducts two main analyses:


Hypothesis Testing to determine if there is a significant increase in sales before and after digital advertising.

Dependency Analysis to investigate whether there is a relationship between the sales managers and the regions they oversee.

The analyses are carried out using statistical methods such as t-tests and chi-square tests.
